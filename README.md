The Pokedox online application is a responsive and interactive platform that allows users to explore, view, and "catch" Pokémon utilizing data from the Pokémon API. The program, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, presents Pokémon in batches, loading additional items with each click of the "Load More" button. Each Pokémon entry includes a thumbnail and a name, and users can click on a Pokémon to see more characteristics such as a larger image, height, weight, color, and skills. A "Catch" button allows players to add Pokémon to their collection, which is saved in local storage and will remain between sessions, with the option to release caught Pokémon as desired.
